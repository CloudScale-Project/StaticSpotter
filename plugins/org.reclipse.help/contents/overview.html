	<h1>Overview</h1>


	<p>A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Design pattern detection is a reverse engineering methodology that recovers design decisions and thereby provides deeper insight into software. Recognizing implementations of design patterns in existing software systems helps the reverse engineer to understand the system.</p>

	<p>Reclipse is a semi-automatic reverse engineering tool which includes a structural and a behavioral pattern recognition. It provides a graphical editor for the specification of the structure of patterns. The pattern specification can include additional parts. The result of a structural analysis is a percentage estimation which shows how much different fragments of the given software system resemble the specified patterns. Fulfilled additional conditions increase this estimation.</p>

	<p>In addition, Reclipse provides another graphical editor for the specification of the patterns behavior. The behavioral analysis rechecks the result of the structural analysis by comparing the softwares behavior to the specified patterns behavior. With the results, the reverse engineer is able to make a better decision, whether a software fragment is an actual design pattern implementation or not.</p>
