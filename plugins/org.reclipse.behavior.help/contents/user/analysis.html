	<h1>Execute a Behavioral Patterns Detection</h1>

	<p>Coming soon!</p>

	<!--
<p> After the static structural analysis is finished, a dynamic behavioral analysis can be executed.
 <a href="../tasks/staticAnalysis.html">Read more
	about executing the structural patterns detection</a>.</p>
	
<p>The behavioral patterns detection requires annotations, traces and behavioral patterns. 
</p>



<p> 
For starting the behavioral analysis follow these steps:
<ol>
	<li> Start the behavioral patterns recognition by selecting "Reclipse" &rarr; "Start Behavioral Patterns Recognition...".</li>
	<li> In the opened dialog (see below), you have to select several file paths:</li>
		<ul><li> the exported annotations file</li>
		<li> the trace file</li>
		<li> the exported behavioral patterns catalog</li>
		<li> the result file for the output of the analysis</li></ul>
	<li> Click "Finish" to start the analysis.</li>
</ol>	
</p>

<p>When the recognition is finished, the "Behavioral Analysis Result"-view opens. 
In the upper combo box you can select the candidate whose results you want to view. 
In the middle on the left you can see the result of the structural analysis and the bounds of the variables.
In the middle on the right you can see the behavioral analysis results including accepted, rejected and not accepted traces, accepted subtraces, the average length of accepted (sub-)traces and the variable bounds for each trace.
Below, there is the trace sequence diagram.</p>
