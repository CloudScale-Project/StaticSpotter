	<h1>Tracing</h1>

	<p>The behavioral pattern recognition of RECLIPSE is a dynamic analysis. It works with runtime data of the software
		to analyze. There are two possibilities to monitor the runtime data: Debugging by using the RECLIPSE TRACER and the
		Instrumentation.</p>

	<p>In order to get the information, which objects and method calls have to be monitored, RECLIPSE needs a trace
		definition</p>

	<h2>Exporting the trace definition</h2>

	<p>Export the trace definition by following these steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the context menu of the analyzed model by rightclicking on it.</li>
		<li>Select "Export..." &rarr; "Trace Definition", click "Next".</li>
		<li>Then select the model which has been analyzed, click "Next".</li>
		<li>On the next wizard page select the path and name of the file which is supposed to contain the exported trace
			definition.</li>
		<li>After clicking "Finish", the trace definition will be exported.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Debugging</h2>
	<p>Start the RECLIPSE Tracer by selecting "Reclipse" &rarr; "Run Reclipse Tracer..." &rarr; "Reclipse Tracer
		Configurations". In the opening dialog, you can create and save a new RECLIPSE TRACER Configuration. There are six
		tabs with several options to set up. Most important are the tabs "Main" and "Classpath", the other options work with
		default values.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Tab "Main": Enter the main class of the program to traced and the working directory. Optionally enter program
			or VM arguments. Specifying the trace definition file is important, too.</li>
		<li>Tab "Classpath": Here you have to add all the directories or JARs that contain source code to be executed.</li>
		<li>Tab "JRE": Select the runtime JRE.</li>
		<li>Tab "Options": Here you can set up some additional options, like optional tracing information.</li>
		<li>Tab "Listeners": You can enable the behavioral patterns inference and/or the trace file logger. Both contain
			important options to set up, for example the annotation file, the pattern catalog or the trace file's name and
			format. Use the behavioral patterns inference for an online and the trace file logger for an offline analysis.</li>
		<li>Tab "Common": Set up further options like the standard input and output and console encoding.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The screenshots below show an example configuration for the tracer: <img src="../../images/tracer1.png" alt="Main tab"
			border="0"> <img src="../../images/tracer2.png" alt="Classpath tab" border="0">
	</p>

	<p>After starting the tracer, the tracer view shows information about the progress.</p>

	<p>The resulting trace file can be found in the eclipse folder.</p>


	<h2>Instrumentation</h2>
	<p>Call the instrumentation wizard with "Reclipse" &rarr; "Instrumentation". The wizard consists of six dialogs.
	<ol>
		<li>In the first dialog, you can decide if you want to create an new configuration or use an existing one.</li>
		<li>On the second page, the java classes or directories and libraries which are to be instrumented, have to be
			selected.</li>
		<li>The third dialog demands the trace definition file and the main class of the monitored program. The
			instrumented classes require a library including the instrumentation's runtime application. This library can be
			inserted into a another input library, or copied into a given directory. The library has to be available for the
			other classes at runtime. In addition to that, a configuration file has to be created. This file has also to be in
			the class path.</li>
		<li>The fourth page is equal to the one in the configuration of the RECLIPSE Tracer as described above.</li>
	</ol>
