	<p>Next, the static pattern detection can be executed over the menu bar: <em>Reclipse</em> &rarr; <em>Start Structural Pattern Detection</em>. To see the details of the analysis results, the pattern matching views are useful.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Start the structural patterns detection wizard by selecting "Reclipse" &rarr; "Start Structural Pattern
			Detection".</li>
		<li>In the line "Pattern Specifications", select the structural patterns catalog you want to use for this
			analysis.</li>
		<li>As "Host Graph Model", select the GAST model parsed from the software system you want to analyse.</li>
		<li>The search engines will be generated automatically, if the check box is not checked. Otherwise you have to
			provide an ecore model that contains the search engines generated from the patterns catalog.</li>
		<li>"Similarity Evaluator" should be chosen as annotation evaluator.</li>
		<li>Next, choose one of the available reporting levels, to specify the amount of details that shall be reported
			during the pattern detection:
			<ul>
				<li>Everything: Every progress information is reported.</li>
				<li>Annotations: Every step and every new annotation is reported.</li>
				<li>Steps: Every step of the process is reported.</li>
				<li>Minimal: Only the start and the end of the process is reported.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Select the check box to search for additional elements which will be used to evaluate rating values for the
			detected pattern candidates.</li>
		<li>Click "Finish" to start the analysis of the GAST. This can take several minutes depending of the size of the
			parsed source code and the number of patterns in the catalog. You can track the progress in the Structural Inference
			Console which opens automatically.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>After the analysis is finished, you may open the view "Annotations" to see the results.</p>

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="../../images/annotations_view.png" alt="Annotations View" />
		<p>Figure: Annotations View</p>
	</div>

	<p>In the Annotations View, annotations can be saved and loaded by the buttons on the upper right corner of the
		view.</p>

	<p>To see more details about the pattern candidates, the Pattern Matching Views can be used.</p>

	<p>Now, you can execute a behavioral analysis to validate the results of the structural analysis.</p>
