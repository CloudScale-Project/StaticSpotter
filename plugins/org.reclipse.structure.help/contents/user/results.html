	<h1>Analyzing the Results</h1>

	<p>The Pattern Matching Views show the details of a detected pattern candidate. They consist of three views: The
		pattern view, the abstract syntax view and the class view.</p>

	<p>The views can be opened via the menu bar: "Reclipse" &rarr; "Open Matching Views".</p>

	<h2>Pattern View</h2>
	<p>The pattern view shows the pattern specification of the selected pattern candidate. The specification is
		enhanced by information about which conditions of the pattern rule are satisfied, and which not. Satisfied conditions
		are illustrated in black, and unsatisfied conditions in gray.</p>

	<h2>Abstract Syntax View</h2>
	<p>The pattern view shows the matched pattern candidate in abstract syntax. There you can view the concrete objects
		that have been matched to the pattern during the inference. For each object the name attributes are shown.</p>

	<h2>Class View</h2>
	<p>Coming soon.</p>

	<h2>Additional Features</h2>

	<h3>Consistent Selection</h3>
	<p>To simplify comparing the detected candidate and the pattern specification, three views provide a consistent
		selection. If an object in one of the views is selected, the according objects in the other views will be highlighted
		as well.</p>

	<h3>Set Contents</h3>
	<p>If the pattern specification of the selected candidate contains set objects, the Abstract Syntax View can show
		all the objects that belong to the content of the set. Use the toggle button "Toggle Set" to control this
		functionality.</p>
