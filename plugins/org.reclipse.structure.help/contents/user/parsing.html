	<h1>Source Code Parsing</h1>

	<p>For the analysis the programs source code have to be parsed into an EMF based model. Reclipse works on a structural model of a software system, the GAST (Generalized Abstract Syntax Tree). As base implementation there is the so called SiSSY Parser.</p>
	
	<h2>Create a GAST with SISSy</h2>
	<p>The GAST (Generalized Abstract Syntax Tree) is a structural model of the source code of a software system. The static pattern detection in RECLIPSE requires a GAST of the system that shall be analysed as input. To create a GAST, the parser SISSy is used.</p>

	<p>SISSy is available via the update site of Q-Impress: http://q-impress.ow2.org/release. It can parse Java, C++ and Delphi code.</p>

	<p>Execute the following steps to create a GAST:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a new Eclipse Run Configuration with "Run As" &rarr; "Run Configurations..." in the context menu of
			your project.</li>
		<li>Right click on "Launch SISSy" to create a new SISSy launch configuration.</li>
		<li>In the first tab "SISSy", choose as "Input paths" the source folder of the project you want to analyze.</li>
		<li>On the second tab "Database Settings" select a database driver, e.g. DERBY. See the screenshot below, for
			example settings, the password is "sissy".</li>
		<li>In the third tab "GAST Output" specify your GAST parameters. Check the box "Write GAST outputfile" and
			provide the path to a .gast file, where the resulting GAST shall be stored.</li>
		<li>After starting the configuration with "Run", SISSy will create a new GAST of the given system, that can be
			used as input for the structural pattern detection of RECLIPSE.</li>
